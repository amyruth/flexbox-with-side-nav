# flexbox-with-side-nav

This is just me trying to make sure my Git Bash works properly since I haven't logged in in a very long time. 
It took all night but it might actually work, as long as I set things up perfectly the first time.
Otherwise, it will be hell on earth.
This is just the Flexbox sample code on MDN that I messed around with to learn how it works.

If you really want to look at it, go ahead. But it was just a tester.
